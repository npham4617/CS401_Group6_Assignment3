Test Plan: StringUtils Class

1. Objective:
   - To verify the correctness and functionality of methods in the StringUtils class.

2. Test Scenarios:
   a. Test for concatenation method:
      - Verify if the method correctly concatenates empty strings.
      - Verify if the method correctly concatenates single characters.
      - Verify if the method correctly concatenates alphanumeric strings.
      - Verify if the method correctly concatenates empty strings.
      - Verify if the method correctly concatenates strings with whitespace.
   b. Test for reverse method:
      - Verify if the method correctly reverses a string.
   c. Test for conversion method:
      - Verify if the method correctly convert a string to upper case.
   d. Test for trimming method:
      - Verify if the method correctly trims a leading whitespace in a string.
      - Verify if the method correctly trims a trailing whitespace in a string.

3. Test Data:
   - For countOccurrences method: Test with strings containing various characters, including special characters.
   - For reverse method: Test with strings of varying lengths, including empty strings and null.

4. Test Environment:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above.
   - JUnit testing framework.

5. Test Execution:
   - Each test case will be executed individually using JUnit.
   - Test results will be recorded and compared against expected outcomes.

6. Test Deliverables:
   - Test report documenting test execution results and findings.
